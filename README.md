Hello members of the Mars! This is Capt. Ritzzii from the planet Sanctum. I am here on a mission 'Eligius-I'.

**Here's some basic shizz:** 
Version Control: A system that allows the developers to save and track the changes made to a project.
GIT: A version control system used to manage developer projects of all sizes (created in 2005 to help developers contribute and share code in a way that is fast, efficient and inexpensive.)

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. 
2. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was    made. 
3. **Commit messages** capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve      done and why.

**Pull Requests:**

1.  Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub.
2.  When you open a pull request: You’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in     your contribution and merge them into their branch. 
3.  Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. 
4.  The changes, "additions" and "subtractions" are shown in "green" and "red".
5.  Once you make a commit: One can open a pull request and start a discussion (even before the code is                                   finished).    
6.  By making use of **mention system** (@mention) in our pull request message, w ecan ask for feedback from       specific people or the teams. 
7.  We can open pull requests in our own repo and merge them ourself.
