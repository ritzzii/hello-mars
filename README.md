Hello, members of the _Mars_! This is _Capt. Ritzzii_ from planet _Sanctum_. I'm here on a mission '_Eligius-I_'.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Here'z some basic shizz:** 

**Version Control**: A system that allows the developers to save and track the changes made to a project.

**GIT**: A version control system used to manage developer projects of all sizes (created in 2005 to help developers contribute and share code in a way that is fast, efficient and          inexpensive).

**GITHUB**: GitHub is a cloud based repository hosting service that allows developers to share the local code with the world.

**Gen Note**:  Each of the pull requests we submit for hackathons should contribute to an existing repo in a way that helps the projects to thrive.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Git Fork and Clone**: Getting the forked repo on to your local machine: Use terminal and give the command **git clone "paste the web URL"** 

1. Identify the repo you'd like to edit. 
2. Take a copy of that repo onto our GITHub account by **forking** and then get onto your local machine by **cloning** 
   (Enter the command **git clone "paste_URL"** on some terminal of our choice). 
3. Then make and submit a change using **git add** command. 
4. To know the status of or changes made in the branch, use **git status** command. 
5. We see that our file/the change has been added but is not committed as a change. 
6. Now once you are confident with the changes you'd made and would like to submit this change    for consideration of those who maintain this project - Execute the command **git commit -m "message_to_be_added_here_within_inverted_commas"** . 
7. Now, in this way, everyone can be informed of changes that are made along with your identity. 
8. Finally, to push the changes from local machine to the remote repository on GITHub execute **git push** command. 

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. 
2. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was    made. 
3. **Commit messages** capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve      done and why.

**Pull Requests:**

1.  Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub.
2.  When you open a pull request: You’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in     your contribution and merge them into their branch. 
3.  Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. 
4.  The changes, "additions" and "subtractions" are shown in "green" and "red".
5.  Once you make a commit: One can open a pull request and start a discussion (even before the code is                                   finished).    
6.  By making use of **mention system** (@mention) in our pull request message, w ecan ask for feedback from       specific people or the teams. 
7.  We can open pull requests in our own repo and merge them ourself.
