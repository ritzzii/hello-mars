Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first time, you’re welcome to participate.

Pull requests can be made in any participating **GitHub** or **GitLab hosted repository/project**. Look for the **'hacktoberfest' topic** to know if a repository/project is participating in Hacktoberfest. Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer of the repository/project to count.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1. Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab.
2. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
3. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
4. If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
5. To get a shirt, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone.
6. This year, the first 50,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

_A repository/project is considered to be participating in Hacktoberfest if the 'hacktoberfest' topic is present and is accepting public contributions via pull requests. An individual pull request can also be opted-in directly by adding the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label._

_A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label. A pull request with any label containing the word 'spam' or 'invalid' will be considered ineligible for Hacktoberfest._
